55 You can export an IntelliJ IDEA project to Eclipse. Such export results in creating Eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) for each module file (*.iml) in the module directory that contains the content root. Another way to export an IntelliJ IDEA module to an Eclipse project is converting such module to an Eclipse-compatible format.

45 At present, migration from IntelliJ IDEA to Eclipse is subject to certain limitations:
IntelliJ IDEA modules with multiple content roots cannot not be migrated.
External sources in Eclipse are not migrated.
Only Java modules are created automatically during the export. However, any module can be converted to the Eclipse compatible format manually.
The default workspace JRE is not converted to/from the project SDK.
